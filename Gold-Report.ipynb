    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is cleverly organized around three main classes: Genetic_Algorithm, Circuit and Validity. The code is run from the main and only requires key parameters such as number of units, number of genrated circuit, probability of mutation, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Genetic Algorithm object is created from the main, and the runAlgo method is used. Within that function, the Generate Circuit is run, along with Validity object and methods, and the Circuit Evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following descriptions runs through the main steps the Circuit Congiguration program, more precisely the runAlgo method, goes through in order to optimise the units layout. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step One : Random Circuit Generation \n",
    "\n",
    "First, an initial ensemble of  circuits is produced. The circuits are defined by vectors of integers. The first number indicates the feed. Then, each pair of numbers indicate the direction of the concentrate (first number in the pair) and the tail (second number in the pair) for each unit. The numbers are drawn randomly, and a certain number of random circuits are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage already the circuits are verified using the Validity object. The circuits are generated iteratively until a certain number of circuits (a 100 for example) is obtained. Once all circuits have been created, a fitness value is obtained through the evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step Two : Circuit Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomly generating circuit vectors results in many vectors that have a low performance. For this reason, a pre-selection is done to the random vectors generated and if they don't meet a certain criteria which are indicative of bad performance then they are regenerated. This way the genetic algorithm can converge to a good solution with a smaller sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to validate the circuit, a Validity object is created using only the size of the circuit. Each circuit generated can then be passed in the Check_Validity method individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four criteria used to validate a circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There should be no self-recycle\n",
    "- The destination for both products from a unit should not be the same (different) unit.\n",
    "- Every unit must be accessible from the feed\n",
    "- Every unit must have a route forward to both of the outlet streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Criteria 1 and 2 were simply tested by looping over the circuit vector -- indexing unit id with iteration number and returning False if 1 of the streams lead to its own id or if 2 streams lead to the same unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Criteria 4 were tested using a recursive approach. We start from a unit's concentrate stream and check that it goes to an outlet. We iterate until an end is seen and if an end is seen we set the value of the global variable seen_conc to True. We do the same for the tail stream and if one of seen_conc or seen_tail variables are false starting from any unit, then we return False. Criteria 3 is a very similar approach to 4 but this time checks that all units can be seen starting from unit 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of a valid circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"report_pic/output_tayfun4.png\" style=\"width: 400px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of invalid circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "This circuit vector is invalid because unit 3 self-cycles and doesnt see the tailing outlet:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"report_pic/output_tayfun1.png\" style=\"width: 400px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The above circuit is also invalid as unit 3 doesn't see the feed:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"report_pic/output_tayfun2.png\" style=\"width: 400px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, invalid as units 1 and 2 doesnt see concentrate outlet and unit 3 doesnt see the tailings outlet. Also, 3 recycles:\n",
    "<img src=\"report_pic/output_tayfun3.png\" style=\"width: 400px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The Circuit_Validate(circuit_vector) function implimented takes a vector type circuit vector and returns a boleen value of True for valid and False for invalid circuits. The functions were tested with the above examples and verified that it works for these test cases (i.e. as expected returns True for the first case and False for the others).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step Three : Circuit Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution depends on three classes: the Circuit class, CUnit class, and CStream class. The CStream class contains the mass flow of the stream components and the necessary operation methods for incrementing and adding streams. The CUnit class contains relevant CStream objects pertaining to their feed and destination streams and methods manipulating the streams for the Circuit Evaluation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the circuit, the Circuit class must be instantiated to create a new Circuit object, the user is given the choice to input their own performance costs and input circuit feeds or to keep the default problem parameters. A single function \"Evaluate Circuit\" is called which takes in a vector of the circuit configuration and convergence parameters.\n",
    "The circuit class contains a vector of unit objects pertaining to the circuit configurations as well as parameters for the circuit evaluation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "The function updates unit's content and calculates the economic performance of the whole circuit using a Jacobian like Iterative method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Fill all units with a the feed values given for valuable and waste component (for example, 10kg/s and 100kg/s) for one second.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the relative difference is less than tolerance, and the total number of time steps is below a certain threshold (until convergence). This assumes time step is one second throughout. \n",
    "\n",
    "2- Transfer the valuable and waste components in each unit in the concentrate and tail streams. The total amount going into each stream can be deducted using the concentrate component fraction (in this case, 20% of valuable and 5% of waste components)\n",
    "\n",
    "3- Reset the input feed to 0, but save the old feed in a variable. Also peform this operation into the two end streams going into the concentrate and trailing bins. This will be used to calculate the relative feed difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "4- Send the concentrate and trail streams calculated in step 2 to their destination units.\n",
    "\n",
    "5- Calculate the relative difference for the two feeds of each unit, using the feed values for each unit claclulated in step 4. Take the largest relative difference for stream valuable and stream waste from all the units.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ {rel\\_tol} = \\frac{feed - {old feed}}{{old feed}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "6- If relative difference is larger than the set tolerance, break the while loop, otherwise run step 2 to 5 again.\n",
    "\n",
    "7- Calculate the performance criteria from the amount of valuable and waste componenent collected in the concentrate bin. If there was no convergence, and the relative difference remained larger then the tolerance through all the time steps, the fitness performance criteria is set to the worst possible value: the total cost of waste (in this case -500£) for the input feed rate (in this case 100kg/s)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Fitness = \\left(total\\,amount\\,of\\,valuable\\,*\\,price\\,of\\,valuable \\right) + \\left(total\\,amount\\,of\\,waste\\,*\\,cost\\,of\\,waste \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimisation of the code was kept in mind. We avoid using if statements in our loops for setting specific values for the circuit output streams in our vector lists and instead directly set the specific values via indexing. This is to avoid using unnecessary if operations in the loop and saves time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To include the output streams in the circuit for evaluation, we include two additional unit objects to contain these streams. In addition, we realised we had to set the correct unit which would recieve the input circuit feed, a problem which we quickly overcame. Finally, we also had to reset the output stream units to achieve convergence as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step Four : Genetic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the generated circuits have been tested and evaluated, the genetic algorithm can be called. This algorithm is in the geneticAlgo method, and returns the best circuit possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "After initialising the list of parent vectors as described above, these vectors and the vector of fitness values are fed in the geneticAlgo function, as well as the desired max iteration and other inputs for the Evaluation_circuit function.\n",
    "This geneticAlgo function was implemented following the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The circuit with the best fitness goes through the next generation unchanged, as calculated in the Circuit Evaluation section using the Evaluation_Circuit function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Two circuits are randomly chosen. The probability of each circuit to be chosen is proportional to its fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) There is about a 20 % probability for the two vectors to cross-over each other and generate two children circuits. If no cross-over happens, the circuits go to the next step unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) There is a small probability (less than 1%) for each component of the two circuits to mutate. When mutating each value, a randomly picked number replace the mutated value. The mutated number cannot be higher than number of units - 1 (for the feed) or higher than number of units + 1 (for all the other elements). To make sure the mutations are within these limits, we take the remainder of the mutated number divided by number of units - 1 or number of units + 1 for the feed and the other elements, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) We  check   the  validity  of  the  obtained   circuits  and,  if   valid,  add   them  to  the  next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) These steps are repeated until enough circuits for the next generation are obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) The parents vectors are replaced with the children and step 6 is repeated until either a number maxIte of iterations or the best vector has not changed for a sufficient number of iterations bestIndCnt. The convergence criteria are implemented in the code as:\n",
    "- the maximum number of iterations maxIte\n",
    "- the minimum number of iterations to be done minIte\n",
    "- the minimum number of iterations bestIndCnt for which the best circuit stays the same, and can end the code if this number is reached \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Two different designs were tested in developing the genetic algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "-    Implementing a class containing a circuit vector and its fitness value\n",
    "-    “Basic” implementation: vector of integers, vector of those vectors and list of fitness values\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, there were some memory problems and as it wasn’t more difficult to store all of the fitness values in one vector, we decided to do the second option.\n"

They can be classified as the convergence criteria of the genetic algorithm, i.e. maxIte, minIte and bestIndCnt presented above, and as the other parameters, i.e. the probability of cross-over proCrosOver, the probability of mutation proMut and the number of child vectors num_circuits. \n",

    "The convergence criteria were modified according to the number of units used and kept constant over the runnings. We had to make sure that the algorithm finishes and that he will converge to the best value of the case. After try and error, we decided to fix the maximum number of iterations to 10000, the minimum number of iterations to 0 and the minimum number of iterations for which the best circuit stays the same to 2500.\n",

    "\n",
    "For this configuration, it takes in average about 8 seconds to run until there is convergence. The fastest convergence takes about 5 seconds, and the slowest can take about 15 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, the algorithm is either running faster in terms of speed but affecting the end value (which would then not be the very best), or giving a better value by waiting more time (changing the convergence parameters notably). Some optimum can be achieved by balancing out both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since for circuits with more units, it will take way more time to run, we would really need to compromise between getting one of the best values and the time taken to run the algorithm as finding the best value may be really time-consuming! \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the generation of the parent vectors is random. Thus, there may be some cases where the genetic algorithm starts with either a \"good\" guess or with a \"bad\" guess. This can affect the convergence and the time taken to find the best vector and fitness value significantly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the code was tested using Visual Studio 2017 on Release mode."

    "\n",
    "An investigation into the model parameters has been carried out. The theory follows that if we have a high concentration relative to waste price then we have a high performance fitting for the circuits produced in our algorithm. Thus, circuits with a bad recovery are found. We test this idea by varying the ratio of concentration to waste price ($ratio = \\frac{conc}{waste}$) from 0 to 2 and measuring performance.\n",

    "<img src=\"report_pic/priceratio.png\" style=\"width: 800px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "From the figure above, we see that when waste price is much higher than concentrate price, we generate a better performing circuit than a lower waste price and high concentrate price. This is because the performance parameter in the Genetic Algorithm becomes more punishing if we have a higher waste price to concentrate ratio and thus produces circuits with better recovery. One recommendation would therefore to be to have a high waste price and low concentrate price when running the program.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to parallelise the circuit validation and evaluation, it was decided to use shared memory and OpenMP. This was thought more efficient than distributed memory because a single circuit vector is passed in the function everytime, no communication is done, and most of the two functions need to run in serial. \n",

This was because, as the code is currently written, if the first test is found to be false, it return false immediately, without running the following three tests. When running the code parallel in section, all four tests needed to be run, then if the bool for any of the four tests is false, only then does the function return false.

It is therefore not easily parallelised, since each iteration needs to know the previous value, and there might be so misscomunnication if a thread runs faster than the other. Otherwise the code could have been altered to set the calculated as private and then compared after the for loop is finsihed. This however requires more code to be written to save the value on the stack, and therefore is not very efficient.\n",

This seemed like an ideal candidate for parallelisation. However when running it, it was actually taking twice as long on average. \n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while OpenMP was thought to be able to parallelise parts of different processes, it actually turned out inefficient in all cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also options to parallelise the entire code using OpenMP, but it was agreed before testing it that using distributed memory to parallelise the whole process would be more efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "The OMP code is still included in the OMP folder. \n",

    "## Distributed Memory - Message Passing Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circuit Validation and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "After analysis, it was decided not to parallelise the circuit evaluation and validation. This is because each function is called only passing in one circuit vector. Therefore it is not necessary to parallelise the content of the two functions, since they need to be run in serial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Genetic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "For the genetic Algorithm, two approaches were taken to parallelise the code using distributed memory with the MPI library:\n",
    "\n",
    "First one runs the total number n of circuits (in base case it's a 100) in each process. Each node will generate their own circuits, and run the algorithm to completion. The master process will also work on its own group of circuits and when finished it will then gather the best circuit obtained by each process. The circuit with the best fitness is then output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach also runs the total number n of circuits on each process. The first process to end its iterations will send a message to all the other processes that will interrupt their calculation. This entails that the best circuit obtained by the processes that finishes first is taken as the best circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A last approach was considered, but later abandoned. This was to split the number of circuit between the processors. However this requires a lot of communication between the processes and therefore will slow down the communication considerably, especially when the code is run only for 100 circuits."
